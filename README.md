# semantix_challenge
Codes used to carry out the Semantix challenge


Notes:
1) Every challenge was drawn up from two files,NASA_access_log_Jul95 and NASA_access_log_Aug95
2) Notebooks were designed with the best legibility and ease in mind.
3)  Thinking about the best analysis of the data, the two files described were merged, so we have NASA_access_log_merged_Jul95_Aug95.csv


Technologies used:
python 3.6.8
jupyter-cliente 5.3.4
ipython 7.11.1
pyspark 2.4.4
